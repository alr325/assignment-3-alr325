## About me 

* I am from a small town called San Juan, located on the central west of Argentina

* I always thought that I was going to study medicine but at the last minute I changed because I love nature and I wanted to work outdoors

* My goal as a researcher is to make science accessible and practical to farmers.

* I have worked for 9 years with alternative crops such as Quinoa and Amaranth
